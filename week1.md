One of the hardest things about programming is resolving dependency errors.  Everytime I am dealing with this it takes forever and I feel like I am missing something that is super important when trying to do this.  Another thing that is difficult about programming is of-by-one errors.  When thinking deeply about a problem, getting it exactly right first try is pretty difficult.  And finally, when working with AI it is really hard to see what you got from it.  Knowing what the code gotten from AI does is a hard problem.

One of the hardest things about software engineering is knowing what your supposed to do.  Especially if you doing something for someone else, getting the vision of a problem and a solution without constantly communicating with the other person is really hard.  It is also hard to know what problems need to be solved.  When building something that you hope someone else will use, knowing what is useful for them and what they will actually want to use is not that easy.  Another thing that is really hard is adding code to a huge code base.

There are several skills that I need to get better at in order to become a skilled software engineer.  One of these is coding with AI (tis the reason I am taking this class).  In the past whenever I code with AI, I can't ever seem to get what I want and I end up wasting a ton of time.  However, if I learn how to use AI to get what I actually want, I can be a lot more efficient.  Another thing that takes way to much time is dealing with dependencies.  When I go to a project that has already been worked on by someone else (or by me in the past), it takes me way to long to get it running.  Fixing these two things will make me a much better programmer.
