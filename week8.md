Git flow has both a master and develop branch because they each have their specific purposes.  Master is a branch that always represents what is live right now.  This should always contain the working code and it is the code that someone actually runs when they use your application.  Develop is a branch for adding new features and getting ready for the next release.  Changes are usually made on a different branch then merged to develop before ever going to master.
A hotfix branch is a branch that is used to fix a bug that is currently live.  This branch is merged straight into master in order to fix the bug as fast as possible.  A feature branch is basically just a normal branch that a new feature is developed in and eventually merged into the develop branch.
A release branch is made when a new version of the software is about to be released.  This is different than the other two because when it is merged into master then it is considered a new version.
If your project doesn't intend to support old versions then you typically only need your master and develop branches and also feature branches and hotfix branches.  Master and develop are still useful to be used in their desired way (master contains the live code and develop is what is merged into master).  Hotfix branches are still going to be needed to fix live bugs and feature branches will still be used to add new functionality.
